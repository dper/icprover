The problem files do not contain the GPL license text simply 
because the parser does not handle comments.  However, I do 
release them under the GPL.  This applies to the following files:
- test/negative-classical.txt
- test/negative-intuition.txt
- test/positive-classical.txt
- test/positive-intuition.txt
- parser/questions.txt
