ICProver
========

ICProver is an automated theorem prover.  It is written in OCaml and implements the intercalation calculus.  More information about this type of proof search can be found in my [master's thesis](https://archive.org/details/thesis_201502), in research by [Wilfried Sieg](http://www.hss.cmu.edu/philosophy/faculty-sieg.php), and on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_deduction).

Current versions of this program should be available on [github](https://github.com/dper/icprover).
